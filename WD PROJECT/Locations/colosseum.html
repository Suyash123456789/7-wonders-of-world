		<p><H2>Introduction</H2>
		Called by the ancient Romans, "Anphitheatrum Flavlum" (Flavian Amphitheatre), the Colosseum is the most famous and impressive monument of ancient Rome, as well as the largest amphitheater in the world.
The name is undoubtedly linked to the large size of the building but derives above all from the fact that nearby there was a colossal statue of Nero and bronze.
In 1990, the Colosseum, along with all the historical center of Rome, the Vatican extraterritorial zones in Italy and the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls, was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, while in July 2007 was included among the New seven Wonders of the World.




		<h2>Construction</h2>
		The construction took place in the area occupied by the enormous house of Nero 's Domus Aurea , built after the great fire of Rome in 64, which was supposed to be a valley surrounded by the hills of Velia , Palatine, Celio , Opium , and Fagutale and was crossed by a stream that ran in the direction of the Tiber along a path that roughly follows the actual street of San Gregorio.
The presence of the pond was abundantly exploited to save on foundations made ??of travertine pillars resting on a ring of concrete continuous , interrupted only by a few culverts for the flow of groundwater that would otherwise have flooded the entire area.

 
After killing the emperor's statue was remodeled to depict the sun god , by adding the appropriate solar crown . The Colosseum was then moved from its original location to make way for the Temple of Venus and Rome under Hadrian . The site of the base of the colossal statue after the move and ' currently marked by a modern tufa base .

The Flavian Amphitheater is elliptical in shape , with a circumference of 527 meters , 188 meters along the major axis and the minor axis 156 57 meters high .
Could hold up to 70,000 seats and the arena was 76 meters x 46 . The first 3 floors were made of arches framed by half-columns , the fourth floor and ' scompartito by pilasters and there were inserted the poles that supported the large curtain into wedges to protect the spectators from the sun.


		<h2>The Colosseum in Ancient Times</h2>
		
During the Roman Empire and under the motto of "Bread and Circuses" the Roman Colosseum (known then as Flavian Amphitheatre) allowed more than 50,000 people to enjoy its finest spectacles. The exhibitions of exotic animals, executions of prisoners, recreations of battles and gladiator fights kept the Roman people entertained for years.

The Colosseum remained active for over 500 years. The last recorded games in history were celebrated in the 6th century.

Since the 6th century the Colosseum has suffered lootings, earthquakes and even bombings during World War Two. Demonstrating a great survival instinct, the Colosseum was used for decades as a storehouse, church, cemetery and even a castle for nobility.

<h2>The Colosseum in the present day</h2>
At present the Colosseum is, along with the Vatican City, Rome's greatest tourist attraction. Each year 6 million tourists visit it. On 7 July 2007 the Colosseum became one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World.
