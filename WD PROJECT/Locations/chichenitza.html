		<p><H2>Introduction</H2>

Chich&#233;n Itz&#225; was a Mayan city on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Although it's an important tourist attraction, Chichen Itza also remains an active archeological site. New discoveries are still being unearthed in the area, providing even more insight into the culture and accomplishments of the Mayan people, who ruled much of present-day Mexico and Central America prior to the arrival of European colonists. Chichen Itza was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988 and, in 2007, it was voted in a global survey as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.
		<h2>History</h2>
		Chich&#233;n was founded about the 6th century CE, presumably by Maya peoples of the Yucat&#225;n Peninsula who had occupied the region since the Pre-Classic, or Formative, Period (1500 BCE-300 CE). The principal early buildings are in an architectural style known as Puuc, which shows a number of divergences from the styles of the southern lowlands. These earliest structures are to the south of the Main Plaza and include the Akabtzib ("House of the Dark Writing"), the Chichanchob ("Red House"), the Iglesia ("Church"), the Casa de las Monjas ("Nunnery"), and the observatory El Caracol ("The Snail").
		There is evidence that, in the 10th century, after the collapse of the Maya cities of the southern lowlands, Chich&#233;n  was invaded by foreigners, probably Maya speakers who had been strongly influenced by-and perhaps were under the direction of-the Toltec of central Mexico. These invaders may have been the Itz&#225; for whom the site is named; some authorities, however, believe the Itz&#225; arrived 200 to 300 years later.
		<h2>Location</h2>
		Chich&#233;n Itz&#225; is located some 90 miles (150 km) east-northeast of Uxmal and 75 miles (120 km) east-southeast of the modern city of M&#233;rida. The only source of water in the arid region around the site is from the cenotes. Two big cenotes on the site made it a suitable place for the city and gave it its name, from chi ("mouths"), chen ("wells"), and Itz&#225;, the name of the Maya tribe that settled there. Chich&#233;n Itz&#225; was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988.
		
		<h2>Cultural importance</h2>

Chich&#233;n Itz&#225; is the best example of the migratory movements that occurred in Mesoamerica towards the Early Postclassic, since it brings together features of material culture from both the Maya area and central Mexico, particularly those of Toltec descent. In addition, Chich&#233;n Itz&#225; was the capital of a large territory in the Yucatan peninsula, led by the Mayap&#225;n league, from 987 to 1200 AD. C. The Chich&#233;n Itz&#225; archaeological site is world famous for the play of light and shadow that occurs on each equinox on the steps of the pyramidal base known as El Castillo. In this, the sun, as it rises over the horizon, 
illuminates the western rafter of the basement, creating triangles of light and shadow that seem to descend to the serpent's head in the rudeness of the rafter. This event, achieved from the correct orientation and inclination of the planes of the basement, it shows the great level of astronomical and architectural knowledge that the Mayans possessed, and which has resulted in being one of the most studied cultures and regions around these issues, in addition to the territorial political organization and the exploitation of resources. Chronology 525 to 1200 AD. C. Main chronological location: Early Postclassic 900 to 1200 AD. C.
