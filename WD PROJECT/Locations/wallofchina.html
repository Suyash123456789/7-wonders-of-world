    <h3 style="text-align:center;font-family:arial">GREAT WALL OF CHINA</h3>
    <p style="opacity:1">The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220-206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.

		<p><H2>Introduction</H2>
		With construction history dating back to 7th century BC, the Great Wall of China stretches up to 21,196 kilometres and is an unforeseen series of fortifications built across China's borders to mark territories. The most well-made parts of the wall are ideal for hiking through lush valleys, snow-capped mountains and a variety of other landscapes. To walk on its historic bricks that were once an ancient battle site, tourists visit its fully restored sections in Beijing and Mutianyu.

<h2>Why was the Great Wall of China built ?</h2>
The Great Wall of China was built as a military defensive line to defend the invasions from some northern nomadic nations. Apart from the function of defense, the wall also boosted the economy, as well as promoted the culture exchange and national integration of different nations at its two sides. In today's era, it is a part of 7 wonders of world for Tourism .


		<h2>The Great Wall's Structure - Walls, Watchtowers, Fortresses</h2>
		
The Great Wall of China was not just a wall. It was an integrated military defensive system with watchtowers for surveillance, fortresses for command posts and logistics, beacon towers for communications, etc.

In the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), the Great Wall was reconstructed to be stronger and more sophisticated, due to better construction techniques being developed.
<ul>
<li><b>The wall body</b> : The Ming Great Wall usually had battlements 1.8 meters (6 feet) high with loopholes and crenels, and parapet walls 1.2 meters (4 feet) high.
<li><b>Flanking towers</b> : Every 500 meters or less (1,640 feet) on the Great Wall there was a flanking tower allowing defenders to shoot arrows at attackers at the face of the wall.
<li><b>Fortresses</b> were built at important/vulnerable access points (passes), such as Shanhai Pass Fortress, Juyong Pass Fortress, and Jiayu Pass Fortress. There were many archery windows and gates on the forts. The fortress gatehouses were the strongest and most impregnable structures on the Great Wall.
</ul>

						<h2>Regions to Visit</h2>
		The official survey by the National Cultural Heritage Administration of China reveals that Inner Mongolia, Hebei, and Shanxi are the top three regions boasting the most Great Wall relics. The walls, crossing 26 degrees of longitude, and not machine-made, appear in totally diversified status and sceneries. Generally the walls in east China are kept in good condition, while those in the wild northwest have been heavily weathered or damaged.
		<br><br>Beijing, owning only 5.38% of all the wall relics throughout China, has the quintessence of the Ming Great Wall. The best-preserved and most-visited sections are generally within 130 km north of downtown Beijing.
